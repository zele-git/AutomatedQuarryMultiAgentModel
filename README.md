# AutomatedQuarryMultiAgentModel
This is a multi-agent model for simulating cyclic transport of materials between loading/unloading stations and dump trucks. The loading station, unloading station and dump truck are modeled as autonomous agent with their own decision making strategy to perform tasks. The agents collaboration aims at completing a mission of transporing a certain tons of material.

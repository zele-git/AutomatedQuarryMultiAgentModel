# Automated Quarry MultiAgent Model
This is a multi-agent model for simulating cyclic transport of materials between loading/unloading stations and dump trucks. The loading station, unloading station and dump truck are modeled as autonomous agent with their own decision making strategy to perform tasks. The agents collaboration aims at completing a mission of transporing a certain tons of material.

**Goals**
- Simulate loader (and unloader), and truk activities in a quarry
- Generate configuration desing (trucks selection of loading, unloading station and roads)
- Analyzing decision making behavior of quarry agents, impacts of road properties such as slope and dynamic properties such as traffic on roads, collaborative mission accomplishment and performances
- Design space exploration on configuration designs for maximizing mission accomplishment
